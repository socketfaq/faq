## 1.2 About this FAQ

__This clearly needs a lot of updating!__

This FAQ is maintained by Vic Metcalfe (vic@acm.org), with lots of assistance from Andrew 
Gierth (andrew@erlenstar.demon.co.uk). I am depending on the true wizards to fill in the 
details, and correct my (no doubt) plentiful mistakes. The code examples in this FAQ are 
written to be easy to follow and understand. It is up to the reader to make them as 
efficient as required. I started this faq because after reading comp.unix.programmer 
for a short time, it became evident that a FAQ for sockets was needed.

The FAQ is available at the following locations:

Please email me if you would like to correct or clarify an answer. I would also like to 
hear from you if you would like me to add a question to the list. I may not be able to 
answer it, but I can add it in the hopes that someone else will submit an answer. Every 
hour I seem to be getting even busier, so if I am slow to respond to your email, please 
be patient. If more than a week passes you may want to send me another one as I often 
put messages aside for later and then forget about them. I'll have to work on dealing 
with my mail better, but until then feel free to pester me a little bit.
