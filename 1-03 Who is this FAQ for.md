## 1.3 Who is this FAQ for

This FAQ is for C programmers in the Unix environment. It is not intended for WinSock programmers, or for Perl, Java, etc. I have nothing against Windows or Perl, but I had to limit the scope of the FAQ for the first draft. In the future, I would really like to provide examples for Perl, Java, and maybe others. For now though I will concentrate on correctness and completeness for C.

This version of the FAQ will only cover sockets of the AF_INET family, since this is their most common use. Coverage of other types of sockets may be added later.
