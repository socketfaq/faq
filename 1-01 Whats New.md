## 1.1 What's New

This top section of the FAQ was always used to draw attention to changes since the last
time the FAQ was published. Long before Stack Overflow, and even before the web developers
turned to usenet to have their questions answered. This FAQ evolved out of 
comp.unix.programmer to hold frequently asked questions about network programming using
sockets on unix platforms.

It quickly spread to the web, and eventually abandoned usenet in favour of a web site that
allowed new questions to be posted, and comments on existing questions to be contributed.
That got out of hand, so we moved it into a discussion forum. Recently the forum has seen
very little legitimate use but volunteers are fighting spam on it every day.

So now we come almost full circle, back to a more static format as was the case on usenet
in the 1990's when it all began. The material is still relevant today for anyone wanting
to dig deeper into how the Internet works.
